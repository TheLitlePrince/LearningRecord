## Native App

_A native mobile app is a smartphone application that is coded in a specific programming language. Native mobile apps provide fast performance and a high degree of reliability and can provide optimized performance and take advantage of the latest technology_

_Here're some of famous apps we use everyday and they all are native apps._

_So ever since there was even an App store to begin with, Native application development has been the standard in mobile. Native applications are written specifically for mobile operating systems such as iOS, Android and Windows._

_Now let's list the **pros** and **cons** of native development:_

#### Pros

- Due to all of the app’s elements being included in a single native package, native applications tend to have fast graphics with fluid animations built in.

- Native applications can access exclusive native APIs in the phone’s operating system such as push notifications, camera, and in-app purchases, which would otherwise be prohibited, or provided in a cumbersome manner on a mobile web application.

- Apple definitely wants to push their brand whenever possible, so they have provided UI components from their UI libraries to make development a little less painful.

#### Cons

- Native applications typically require designers to define phones and tablets separately, or define individual layouts. While this step is available and repeated on the web with CSS media queries, it’s usually a single layout and multiple style-sheets. The effort for native is non-transferable between iOS, Android and others since each operating system is locked into proprietary tooling.

- If you intend to also publish your app to a different app store, your application will need to be rewritten in order to be a native app on another mobile OS. This usually delays features for the next platform in development.
