## Learning Notes

_Step by step to build a project_

> vue create MyVue
>
> cd MyVue
>
> npm run serve

_Now it's complied_

**Just like live server for html,
we can view code changes in real time with the local or network url.**
_Project directory_

## Learning Summary

### Responsive Design

_In Vue.js, I only need to bind the view to the corresponding model, and it can automatically observe the changes of the model and redraw the view. This feature makes my coding process quite simple and intuitive._

### HTML-based template syntax

_Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax which we can bind the DOM to the underlying Vue instance's data. And in this way, I can design my project more easier than original javascript which I have experinced in summer._

### Bettrt Efficiency and Performance

_In the process of learning the basic grammar of vue.js, I can feel the efficiency of the Responsive Design, which is much faster than the project programmed by original javascript._

### Orderly Front Framework

_This is th first time I learn a front framework, and I think that a framework is to develop a set of norms or rules, which I can work under this to focus more on funtions and features._
